                <ul>
                    <li>You can not make multiple accounts. One user should have only one account. Failing this may
                        result in
                        banning all your accounts.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for your money and safety when dealing with others. Please do your
                        diligence. We try
                        our best to do our part.</li>
                    <li>We reserve the right to suspend your account any time without notice. This includes discrediting
                        your
                        coins balance.</li>

                        banned.
                        If you chose to share your contact details with a tutor, it's your responsibility to verify
